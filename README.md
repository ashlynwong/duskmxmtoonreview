# a review of _dusk_ by mxmtoon

Hi, my name is Ashlyn Wong, and I am a huge fan of Maia, otherwise known as mxmtoon. _dusk_ launched on October 1, 2020, which is now streaming on all platforms, including Spotify and Apple Music. You can find all of the links to _dusk_ [here](https://mxmtoon.ffm.to/dusk).

### my favorite songs
As a huge fan of her music, I have absolutely zero complaints about any of the songs in the album, but my favorite few have to be _ok on your own_, _asking for a friend_, and _myrtle ave._

## overall
I would highly recommend checking out and listening to _dusk_, along with Maia's other music! Compared to her earlier albums, this album sounds a lot more complex and I could definitely tell that she and her team spent a lot of time on producing the songs. For example, in her album _plum blossom_, most of her songs would be composed of only her voice and her ukulele whilst it now has lots of different musical instruments and sound effects. Be sure to listen to both _dawn_ and _dusk_, available on all platforms now!
